# On the Origins of Chimaera

In the past, catastrophe struck the Earth. The cause is not quite known, but this brief period of time completely changed the trajectory of the world. Whether it be disease, climate crisis or war, the Earth's ecosystems began to collapse. The environment became more unstable and mass extinction events occurred across the globe, caused by famine, flood, and frenzy.

Riots burst out in every country to blame the Facilities. These Facilities were expansive research stations, where the elite researching conglomerates experimented in the fields of physics, quantum mechanics, biomedicine and chemistry. Particle colliders, dark matter detectors, satellite arrays, supercomputers, and nuclear generators were among the much large-scale equipment within the Facilities.

As billions of people died rioting, the uber-rich retreated to space ‘safe havens’ and the directors of the Facilities secured themselves in underground bunkers. A small charitable research community within the Facilities were the only ones you had not given up hope, not yet.

Every attempt to stabilise the Earth’s ecosystems had been met with roadblock after false start, after dead end. If the Earth could not be halted in its continual turmoil, then the only option left was to adapt. And so began a decade long endeavour to produce the Serum. This Serum encouraged the rapid resequencing of the genome, constructed from the few thriving species, and artificially spliced with pathogenic genomes. The researchers in their last ditch effort long after the radio frequencies had gone silent, released the Serum as a contagious virus.

In the present day, those researchers have disappeared from living and written history. But they were successful. Life on the Earth still persists today, but in no recognisable way from the perspective of the old precursor humans. Creatures are now mutants constructed from various animals’ body parts. The Facilities are either abandoned or home to Ghastly Mutated creatures who feed on vats of Serum. These creatures are formidable and abhorrent. Small communities, colonies and packs of creatures now make up small pockets of urbanised environments among the perilous wilderness.

## The Timeline

In the world of Chimaera it is assumed that the catastrophe happened long ago, and that mutants is common, and societies are small and fragile. However, ultimately it is up to you how long the earth has had time to heal. Has it been only a few hundred years, new civilisations are forming, creatures are only just beginning to understand their new-found power. Has it been a fair bit longer? Civilisations have risen and fallen, empires exist and are beginning to tame the chaotic world. Is the great catastrophe ancient history? Cities span the earth, globalism and nation trade are common and interconnected. How would these times in history be different to what they were before the great catastrophe? How do cities work when people can fly, swim or walk? How do civilisations function without the need for tools?

## The Rubble

Much of humanity's technologies are broken, cities have fallen leaving only remnant concrete obelisks and malfunctioning tools. No one really knows how to fix any of these things, so tools easily degrade and fall apart. The only sign of humanity that has remained intact are the mysterious Facilities which are scattered out in the wilderness. Of course there are sometimes whispers and sightings of the ancient humans out in the far reaches of the world, but these are most likely just stories with little merit.

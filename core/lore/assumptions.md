# The World of Chimaera

Chimaera is set during a post-bio-apocalyptic world. In the past a catastrophe unkown occured which pitted some of the earth's greatest scientist to develop advanced technologies to save it. The details of the catastrophe ellude historians, some predict it was some form of disease, other's beleive it was a climate crisis, or perhaps a world ending war. Regardless of the exact details the following is widley believed by the new forms of civilisation:

**Mutanism is Common:** The act of modifying your body for different needs is not taboo. Farmerâ€™s can often be seen changing out their hands for scythe-like appendages when harvest time comes. Similarly advanced combatants can be observed quickly metamorphosing their bodies to gain the advantage in a duel.

**Tools are no longer needed:** With the ease of biological modification most tools and weapons became redundant. With fewer people requesting such items the production and tradecraft ceased entirely. Tools are exceedingly rare. Someone using a tool over their biological systems is often met with confusion or whispers about their membership to fanatic anti-mutant groups.

**There are different Degrees of Mutanism:** Different creatures mutate differently. Some life when it was exposed by the great catastrophe, merely mutated once, and from then on remained in its mutated state unable to change. The majority of life established the ability to fuse with other parts, attaching new limbs, organs or senses. Rarely seen and the most exotic are those that have an intimate connection and control over their own DNA. Creatures like this are able to resequence their genome, allowing them to actively and quickly reshape their being into near whatever they want.

**The World is Untamed:** Most of the world is made up of dangerous environments, hostile weather and untamed wilderness. While there are settlements, they are few and far between. The settlements that do exist are often plagued with raids from other settlements and ambushes from terrifying creatures.

## The Age of Mutants

The people of today are mutanous, body parts can be detatched and fused together, allowing a wide range of abilities and forms, and societies. People trade, fight for and collect body parts to use in almost every part of their daily life, whether it be working on farms, hunting in the wilderness or socialising with friends. Due to this way of life tools and manufacturing became obsolete, thus nowadays it is a lucky find to aquire a working piece of gear. The precursor species known as humans are all but extinct, while most died out during the catastrophe those that remained have intergrated into mutanous society as part of the collective body part supply.

## Tribalism and Diversity

Due to the breakdown of society there are no large scale civiiliations, and the most common form of society found are small towns or roaming packs and herds. Some colonies are seen to grow into large and orderly cities run by hive minds, others form with symbotic relationships of mutal benefits through alliances. Furthermore regardless of the size of the society every individual will likley be completely unique, mostly due to every creature constantly changing out their body parts for whatever is useful at the time.

## Precursors

The ancient eath spanning species known as the Humans have been extinct for a long time. Little is known about them except they once dominated the globe but due to some world defining event have disappeared. Some of the creations they had made still remain intact, namely the Serum and the Facilities. These are scatterd throughout wilderness but are often inhabitiated by the Gahstly Mutated so explorers be ware.

## The Serum

The serum was the primary solution to the great catasptophe as most of humanity were going extinct the world's last scientists devised a serum which would strengthen the surviviability of the human species to outlast the impacts of the catastrophe, however what occured after the serum was deployed across world to every living thing could not be predicted. The serum did enhance the survivability of all creatures, however instead of enhancing DNA with new genomes it made DNA highly volatile, causing it to easily shift and change, leading to the mutability of all creatures.

## Intelligent Life

Most life is highly chaotic and ever changing, the environments range drastically more so than ever. Intelligent life still remains among the earth, with different factions, groups and leadership establishing their lands and power. Attitudes among these groups vary greatly however the underlying understanding of life is far different to what they once were.

## The Ghastly Mutated

The Ghastly Mutated are creatures of the most chaotic and dangerous nature. They vary wildly in ability, intelligence, ferocity, but they are always powerful and a threat to much of the fragile societies that exist in Chimaera. The most simple Ghastly Mutated are wild beasts with instatiable rage, they may hoard body parts that they utilise all at once, tearing, biting, poisoning and crushing their foes simultaneously. Others maintian unbreakable parastic relationships with other creatures being able to control the will of others for their own gain, commanding armies to enslave more and more civilisations. Others display an unparalled cunning, while they may not be strong themselves they will lay out traps and tricks of deadly design, and manipulate others to achieve their ulterior motives.

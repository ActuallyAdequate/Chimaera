# Difficulty

Whenever a Player is about to make a roll you can add a difficulty modifier to their roll. The difficulty represents the inherent challenge of a situation.  It is a modifier that will reduce the number of dice they can roll. This allows you to make some challenges be more inherently difficult. It is not advised that you use difficulty when a roll is combat based or used against a particular creature. It is more relevant when a die roll is to overcome a static challenge, such as retrieving information from memory or hiding in a lit room, or using the Ta Da! Ability.

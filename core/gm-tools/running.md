# Running The Game

## Managing Players

### Setting Expectations

It is important to ensure that all players have an understanding of how the game will function, what topics are to be avoided and what is deemed acceptable play. This may be different for each group and it is advised that before beginning play, you as the GM discuss with your players what will be appropriate during your sessions. Below are some key topics you may want to cover:

### Be Willing to Adapt

It is likely the player's character will continually change what body parts they have. They should expect to need to change their parts many times. It is quite possible that a favourite body part will be ground to mush.

### Acceptable Topics

Have an open discussion about what topics the group is alright to engage with. Everyone has different reactions to violence, drugs and sexual themes. Your group may want to outright ban some themes or may prefer to not discuss them in detail when they do come up.

### The GMs Call Is The Final Call

If there is disagreement over a rule or event the GM has the final say as to the outcome. Just ensure you maintain a consistency so the players don’t feel blindsided by an ever changing standard.

### Don’t Take It Too Seriously

This is a game where wacky creatures punch each other up. It is not a game of ever precise and consistent strategy.

## Managing The Mutated

### Refreshing Catabolic Points

Catabolic points allow players to execute their coolest abilities. It is important to ensure you balance how often you refresh a character's CP. Too often, and there may be no challenge to any encounters you give them, too little and your players won’t be able to use the cool abilities they worked so hard to get.

It is recommended that you refresh CP after each encounter. This may be at the conclusion of a fight, after an adventure through a facility or at the conclusion of an interaction at a town.

### Providing Serum

The Mutated need Serum to get stronger in each of their attributes and accrue more Catabolic Points. The serum can be used as reward for defeating the Ghastly Mutated, at the end of an adventure. Serum provides a way for the Mutated players to move forward and develop their characters. In general the players should have defeated a powerful creature each session and thus should get Serum roughly each session.

### Handling Revival

As the GM it is your role to provide challenging situations for the players to overcome, sometimes this may result in a death or two. The Mutated in Chimaera Syndrome can be revived when they are defeated. This should require time, and perhaps the party must return home to heal before trudging on. Don’t be too worried about making a cost for revival. The player will have already lost all their Body Parts which should be costly enough.

### The Ta Da! Ability

This Ability is intended to cover all bases for odd circumstances that are not directly related to the other abilities. It is important to ensure that this ability is used only when it makes sense, that is if a character could reasonably overcome a challenge despite the specific Abilities they have.

> You as the GM need to be careful about allowing this ability in certain situations to ensure that player’s with Specialised Abilities don’t feel cheated. A key way to do this is to break the principle of Partial Failure. Most abilities still allow you to succeed at an action at a cost. Instead when the Ta Da! Ability fails, the player should not succeed at their action and there should be a consequence for failure. This prevents the Ta Da! Ability from being overpowered in the face of more specialised earnt Abilities.

## Managing Creatures

The primary threat to the Mutated are the dangerous creatures of Chimaera. As the GM it is your role to manage the creatures that will attack the players. Below are a few tips on how to manage multiple creatures and keep up the pace.

### Building Creatures

It is quite simple to create a variety of creatures for an encounter. This can be done as preparation for a session or spontaneously. Simply by mashing together a few Body Parts  and selecting a value between 2-10 for each Attribute some CP you can have a working creature for your players to fight.

### Playing Creatures

The most important aspect of playing creatures in an encounter is knowing what Body Parts they have. You can simply scrawl down what Body Parts and Abilities they have if needed but it is important to keep track of how much each one is damaged to ensure an engaging fight as player’s can tacticilyy take out the most dangerous Body Parts first. This can simply be done by marking a line next to each Body Part to represent the Disrepair. Once it has 3 lines it's Broken and cannot be used anymore.

> If playing with Body Part Cards, it is not recommended to have each creature’s cards lined up in front of you as you may run out of cards for your players. Instead you can just collect a couple of cards on hand to give out to players in the event they Sever your creatures Body Parts, and rely on the chance that most Body Parts get obliterated anyway.

### Dealing and Taking Damage

In order for your players to feel in control of their character it is important to give them agency over what Body Parts get damaged. Thus when a player deals damage to one of your creatures allow them to target a specific Body Part. This allows them to neutralise threats that they are more vulnerable to first and will promote a more tactical and engaging combat experience. When your creatures damage a player, allow the player to choose what Body Part of theirs takes that damage. This means less thinking for you and more opportunity for decision making for your players.

## Difficulty

Whenever a Player is about to make a roll you can add a difficulty modifier to their roll. The difficulty represents the inherent challenge of a situation.  It is a modifier that will reduce the number of dice they can roll. This allows you to make some challenges be more inherently difficult. It is not advised that you use difficulty when a roll is combat based or used against a particular creature. It is more relevant when a dice roll is to overcome a static challenge, such as retrieving information from memory or hiding in a lit room, or using the Ta Da! Ability.

Difficulty | Number of Dice to Remove Before Rolling
-|-
Easy | -0
Tricky | -1
Challenging | -2
Hard | -3
Complicated | -4
Impossible | Say: “No, that is not possible.”

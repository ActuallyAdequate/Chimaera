# Ecosystems

The ecosystem encapsulates the location that encounters occur. You may have a single encounter or many encounters set in an ecosystem. The ecosystem should provide a contextual description of the surroundings, creatures, and interactions of the area being explored. Ecosystems, while beginning as a backdrop, will begin to present obstructions, challenges or threats when they become more hostile, as you spend your Hazards.

When mapping out the point crawl map for a session, make sure you track the hostility of each Ecosystem so when the Mutated leave and return the Ecosystem continues to provide a challenge.

## Building Ecosystems

Ecosystems are comprised of two components, a description and hostility. The description will detail the flora and fauna found in the ecosystem, the landscape, and any other features. Make sure that when creating the ecosystem you focus on its more or less permanent features. Seasons and weather are controlled by the weather hexes, and the interactions and dangers are described by the hostility.

The second component - hostility - outlines a list of changes that the ecosystem evolves through. When increasing the hostility, you can spend the number of hazards listed to change the ecosystem as described.

## Spending Hazards on Ecosystems

The Ecosystem's Hostility increase only unlocks when the stated number of Hazards are allocated to the chosen change. For some ecosystems you can unlock any new change in any order. However, some must be unlocked in the order specified. If one change requires a previous change there will be an arrow connecting them indicating that the first change must be unlocked in order to allocate Hazards to the next one.

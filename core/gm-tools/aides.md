## Generating a Creature

When generating a creature select its threat level for each creature component. It's often a good idea to mix threat levels. A versatile creature may have a weak score for attributes and catabolic points, but perhaps it has a dangerous score for its DRB and Body Parts. Or perhaps you have a Dangerous creature, but it has a hazardous amount of Catabolic Points.

| Creature Component |      Weak        |      Dangerous      |      Hazardous      |
|--------------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Attribute Score    | 2d6 take lowest  |   2d6 take highest  |      2d6 added      |
| Catabolic Points   |      1d6         |         2d6         |         3d6         |
| Body Part Cards    | 1 Body Part Card | DRB Body Part Cards | DRB Body Part Cards |

> The Attribute values should range between 2 and 10, so if a roll results higher or lower, either re-roll or set it as the maximum or minimum values respectively.

> If you draw a duplicate Body Part Card, discard it without replacing it. Not every creature would have a maximum number of Body Part Cards.

## Selecting A Random Creature

Each Creature rolls 1d6 if it lands on a one, then they are selected. Before rolling, a creature may be able to justify why they should be included/excluded from the selection process. For example, when randomly selecting a creature caught by a tornado, a Mutated may exclude themselves by saying they are taking cover under a heavy rock formation.

## Selecting A Random Direction

| 1d6 | Direction |
|-----|-----------|
|  1  |   Left    |
|  2  |   Right   |
|  3  |   Upward  |
|  4  |  Downward |
|  5  |   Back    |
|  6  |   Front   |

## Random Weather

Weather is generated by traversing a hexagonal grid with a marker. This allows the change in weather make sense.

At the beginning of the session you will choose a season and select the hex-flower for that season. Then Place a marker on one of the three hexagons below the Event hex.

Each encounter you roll 2d6. The result determines which way the marker is moved. According to the legend hex in the top corner. For example a value of 3 or 4 will mean moving the marker to the adjacent hex at the bottom left of the current hex. Or a roll of 11 will mean staying on the current hex. Or a roll of 2 or 12 will mean moving up one hex. If you move in a direction that takes you off the hex-flower, you either follow the arrow, or move to the opposite hex on the other side.

### Special Weather Events

Landing on one of the bright green-yellow tiles will result in a weather event. Lookup the name of the weather event in the Environment chapter under Weather Events which explains the effect.

Additionally, landing on the Event hex in the centre will cause some other memory event to occur for the encounter. This can be one of your choosing or design, or you can select from the Environmental Events in the Environment chapter.

Landing on a Dark Green hex signifies particularly extreme weather. This will incur some difficult Condition placed on the Creatures. This can be found in Sever Weather Effects, in the Environment Chapter.

## Random Environment

Environments can also be randomised with a hex-flower. Each hex provides a theme for the environment leaving the exact details up to you. The centre hex is for other Unique environments, or the Mutated Habitat or even the Ghastly Mutated's Lair.

Moving around the Environment hex-flower works the same as the weather hex-flower, however rolling 11 makes you move to the unique hex.

# Hazards

Your role as GM is to introduce adversity to the Mutated so they can fight, problem solve, and adventure. You do not require Hazards to create these situations for the Mutated, this is something left to you to control the pacing and difficulty.

Hazards are a way for additional problems to occur in response to the Mutated's Action. The more the Mutated push their luck by failing Challenges, the more hostile their Environment becomes.

Below are is a list of how Hazards are allocated when they are given to You.

- **Immediate Consequence:** You immediately spend the Hazard to create a drawback to the Action.
- **Ecosystem Hostility:** Allocate it to one of the hostility changes for the ecosystem that the Mutated are in.
- **Weather Change:** Move the Marker for the Weather in a direction of your choice.
- **Ambush:** Save The Hazard to get creatures to ambush the Mutated when travelling from one ecosystem to another.

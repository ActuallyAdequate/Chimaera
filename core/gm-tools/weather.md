# Weather

Weather is determined by using a Weather hex, to track the changes of the weather in a dynamic way without changing it completely at random.

>[!INFO] How to use a random hex
> At the start of the session place a marker on the starting Hex signified by the double outline. Then for each encounter pull out the bottom card of the Body Part Deck. The result determines which way the marker is moved. According to the legend hex in the top right. For example a value of 2 will mean moving the marker to the adjacent hex at the bottom left of the current hex. Or a value of 7 will mean staying on the current hex. A value of 8 or 1 will mean moving up one hex. If you move in a direction that takes you off the hex-flower, you either follow the arrow, or move to the opposite hex on the other side.

## Extreme Weather

Landing on a Dark Green hex signifies particularly extreme weather. This will incur some Condition placed on the Creatures. This can be found under Severe Weather Effects labelled Weather Hex's season.

Landing on one of the bright green-yellow tiles will result in a weather event. Lookup the name under Weather Events which explains the effect.

Additionally, landing on the Season Change hex in the centre will cause the season to change. Grab one of the other Weather hexes, and place the marker on the starting position.

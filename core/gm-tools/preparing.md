# Preparing the Game

In order to prepare for a game you will need to organise a time to play with some friends (or enemies, whoever actually will be available and punctual). There are a few resources you may need to play the game.

You will definitely need a note-taking apparatus such as pen and paper, or a computer. This will be needed to keep track of your creatures and their Body Parts, Disrepair, and Turn orders. After that any other resources are entirely optional.

> Body Part Cards make managing body part damage more tactile and interesting as well as easily placing the ability descriptions right in front of the player. However, this too can be managed with pen and paper or a computer just like any other RPG.

> Miniatures can provide a more tactical experience of combat however the system is designed to facilitate the ease of using Theatre of Mind play.

You may want to make a narrative of your own for your players to explore and overcome a series of related challenges that provides a satisfying resolution. Following is a tool to aid in the creation of a session called a Stanza. This should provide a build up of power for your players to fight off the Ghastly Mutated.

## Designing a Stanza

A Stanza in Chimaera is a story arc, it may be your wish that this forms a complete and resolute one-shot or multi-shot session or that it leads to further story arcs that are all interconnected to create a more complex campaign.

The conclusion of a Stanza will usually end in face-off with a wacky, horrifying or malevolent creature known as the Ghastly Mutated, this creature will provide a significant challenge to the group requiring their preparation and selection of Body Parts to combat the dangerous monster.

> While it has been decided to name the Ghastly Mutated and The GM the same (primarily because it works so nicely.) It is important to note like many other RPGs, The GM is never facing off against the group. It is their role to provide a challenging and most importantly fun experience for the whole party.

> Remember the players can never die, but they can be dismembered if you so like.

A Stanza is developed with a 3 by 3 design, that is 3 phases each made up of 3 encounters. This is a tool that you should break, but is helpful to make sure the party knows who to fight, how to fight and why they fight.

Below explains the phases and encounters, but before going ahead it is important that while they may be made with a particular order in mind, they may not be engaged with by the group in that particular order. It is absolutely viable that once they know who to fight the group tries and fails to fight the Ghastly Mutated, they may then go and find a variety of Body Parts, and then go out and fight again skipping some of the initial encounters they dealt with the first time round. It doesn’t matter if the players don’t need some encounters, the 3 by 3 design approach is used to make sure you as the GM are prepared to provide the player with certain encounters should they need it.

## 3 by 3 Design

### Phase 1: Preparation

#### Help I Have A Problem

This will most likely be the first encounter for the group, it's the initial hook that will get the group motivated to deal with the problem at hand. It should introduce the problem, why it matters to the group and if desired what prospects of a reward they may get.

The hook may be a request by a citizen of the world to help with an issue, or it may be an anonymous letter that draws them in, or the need for a new habitat. The initial hook doesn’t need to give away the presence of the Ghastly Mutated, it could be a request by the mayor to investigate missing livestock. Or it could be a personal issue to the group, maybe a threat to a companion.

#### Ah so That's the Real Problem

This encounter will ensure that you have a way for the group to learn more about what they are going to fight so that they can gather the resources needed. The encounter will include details on possibly how the Ghastly Mutated fights, or what Environment they need to travel through, what are commonly known threats or dangers.

This can be achieved either through a helpful hermit who may offer information for a price, or a briefing paper by the general of an army. The group may learn details through an initial fight that they succeed or fail.

Depending on the attitude of your group you may include hooks to guide the players to information or if they are more experienced make the information a challenge to find.

#### Need Something?

This presents an opportunity for the players to gather the needed body parts and resources to accomplish their mission.

The most straightforward implementation is to ensure a merchant is available to sell resources, or the group could be tipped off to a possible heist to steal the resources. If your group is a fan of fighting you may want to swap this for an additional “Trouble on the Way” Encounter to allow the party to gain the resources through salvaging the corpses of those they fight.

### Phase 2: Exploration

#### So How Do We Get There?

This represents an opportunity to gather intel on the location of the Ghastly Mutated, as well as possible routes to the location so they can avoid certain dangers.

If the group likes running in, perhaps they follow the noises of dangerous creatures only to stumble upon the lair of the Ghastly Mutated completely unprepared, Or if they seek out a guide perhaps they manage to locate a secret entrance to the cave. If the party takes it slow scanning the bush for disturbances perhaps they see a group of mutated creatures before the mutated creatures see them allowing them to set up an ambush.

##### Trouble On The Way

This represents an Encounter involving a possible fight. If the group is prepared they may see the trouble coming, or if not they will be ambushed. This also presents an opportunity to gather some extra resources or Body Parts.

##### A Bad Omen

This Encounter involves a non-combative obstacle. Perhaps a series of traps are laid out through the woods. Perhaps the weather takes a turn, and a blizzard obstructs sight. This can give the players a puzzle to solve which can be cleverly disarmed or brutally torn apart.

### Phase 3 : Final Showdown

#### Trial At The Gates

This offers an Encounter usually in a more claustrophobic or tactical setting. This will require the group to use all the skills and tools they’ve attained facing off horrid creatures or bypassing wicked traps.

Most commonly this encounter will form some sort of cave, dungeon or facility. The group will explore rooms until they reach the Ghastly Mutated. However, don’t be afraid to mix this up, perhaps it takes place in an open field where they must fight hordes before combating the animalistic leader. Maybe they’re in a town overrun with creatures where they must save the citizens from the impending invasion.

#### Behold the Ghastly Mutated

This is what the group has been waiting for, time to deal with the root of all their problems. They will fight, scare off or detain the crazed creature of their nightmares.
Everything has been leading up to this, allow the group to have fun taking down the Ghastly Mutated, make sure it's challenging, and when each member of the group has shown off their powerful mutation allow for one final strike to silence the beast.

#### Got the Goodies/Yeah lets Scram

Here lies two divergent paths. If the group was successful it's time to raid the creature for its parts, return home and be heralded for eliminating the scourge from the world. Or perhaps the group were a little too keen and a little too underprepared. When their bodies are falling apart, they may need a way out, a suspenseful escape, a secret passageway or final stand.

## Designing Encounters

For each of the above phases in the 3 by 3 design you need to make 3 encounters. These are interactions that your players will need to navigate in order to get what they want. Below are some questions that can prompt the creation of these encounters:

- Is the encounter a fight?
  - What creatures will they fight? How Many?
  - What is the environment like? Is it difficult Terrain? Is there dangerous weather?
  - Do they have a way out?
  - Are there any creatures in hiding awaiting an ambush
  - How do the creatures attack and hunt, what senses do they have, how do they move?
- Is the encounter dangerous?
  - Is there dangerous weather, cliffs, holes, falling trees and rocks?
  - Has the place been rigged with traps?
  - Is it only dangerous if they get caught? Who are they hiding from what sense do they have?
- Is the encounter social?
  - Are they trying to get information, bargain or deceive someone
  - What does the other creature want, are they friendly, dismissive, arrogant, desperate
  - Will money, favours or distractions help?
- Is the encounter exploration?
  - What are they looking for, are there any clues to find it?
  - Does weather or environment have any effect on the exploration
  - Are they trying to race someone to the destination, can they slow the other team down?
  - Do they have enough information yet, who can help them get more?

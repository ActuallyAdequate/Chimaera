# Habitat

## Managing The Habitat

The Habitat is in primary control of the players, however each of the creatures that find a home there are subject to their own desires and motivation. Sometimes the Habitat can be under threat of attack as well, and will require the Mutated to protect it.

### New Creatures

While on expeditions the Mutated may find creatures they wish to join their habitat. New creatures can provide services for the Mutated when given a place to live and building to work in. If they aren't provided both those things they will not provide services. Creatures can also be hired to join the group on adventures, or ask for favours and provide the group new adventures.

Creatures joining the habitat also need a den to live in, which can be built. However, if a creature is never given a den after asking the Mutated they will become unhappy and leave the Habitat. Similarly, if the group never helps out creatures need, they may leave seeking help elsewhere.

### New Buildings

Most building require the cost of the entire track of resources to build. Some options of buildings are suggested in the Habitat section, but feel free to invent more, and allow your players to dream up their own buildings, as they are the experts on what the Habitat needs.

### Habitat Events

Events can occur in habitats, these may be random events or may be one of the encounters in a Stanza. Events could be any of the following: Creature Favours, Invasion by another habitat, Severe Weather, The Ghastly Mutated, or Refugee Creatures seeking a new home. Whenever the Mutated return to their Habitat, roll 1d6, if it lands on a 6, a Habitat Event Occurs.

# Breaking the Body

## Injury

When the Mutated gains an injury whether from an attack or an accident, they must make a choice. The mutated can either take an injury to a Body System, this will temporarily but significantly inhibit the use of multiple Body Parts for the remainder of the encounter. Or they take an injury to their Body, which permanently damages them and risks them losing Body Parts.

### Injury Types

There are two types of Injury you can receive Physical and Internal. Both Injuries a resolved in the same way either taking an injury to the Body or a Body System. However, some Body Parts may grant resistance or defences to particular Injury types.

- **Physical:** Represents brute injuries such as scratches, breaks, and punches
- **Internal:** Represents illness injuries such as poisons, diseases, and ruptures

### Taking an Injury to a Body System

When taking an Injury to a Body System you must choose one of the Body Systems that will take the Injury. That body system then becomes Inhibited and so no Body Parts that are a part of that system can be used. The Body Parts can still be Activated such as if it were part of limb or if it was directly connected to the Body with other Body Parts Attached to it. However, the abilities on the Inhibited Body Parts should be ignored.

### Taking an Injury to the Body

When taking an Injury to the Body, you must select one directly connected Body Part and increase its Disrepair by 1. If increasing the disrepair would cause it to become Broken, then all other Body Parts that are connected to the Broken Body Part cannot be used either as if they too are Broken. Similarly, if the Body Part becomes Severed or Obliterated, then so too does all the other connected Body Parts.

## Disrepair

1. **Healthy:** The Body Part functions normally and is at full health
2. **Scarred:** The Body Part is still functioning but appears bruised and cut.
3. **Sceptic:** The Body Part is heavily damaged puss seeping from deep wounds.
4. **Broken:** The Body Part no longer works and rests limp on your body.

> If you decide to take an Injury to a Broken Body Part, it becomes Obliterated, meaning it is discarded and cannot be healed.

### Special States of Disrepair

Some Abilities will allow for the following special states of Disrepair.

- **Obliterated:** The Body Part is completely destroyed, it cannot be healed and is no longer attached to the Body. It canâ€™t be picked up and used. It is now bloody mush on the floor.
- **Severed** The Body Part is torn off from the Body. It will fly in the air to the creature that severed it. They can then spend an Action to take the Metamorphosis Ability, to attach the severed piece.

If playing with Body Part cards, the orientation of the cards will correspond to the level of disrepair:

> Alternatively you can use paperclips to mark the Disrepair level.

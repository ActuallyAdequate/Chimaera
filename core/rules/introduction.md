# Chimaera

Chimaera is a hack and slash role-playing game set in a world where one must mutate their body with all manner of crude biological weaponry. Tack on extra limbs and become the arachnid monstrosity. Alter your brain and become a psychological freak. Will you tear through your enemies claiming their body parts into a mound of trophies worn on your back, or will you carefully select what body parts are sanitary to become a keen and precise instrument of death?

## Playing Chimaera

In order to play, one will need a group, most of which will be willing to undergo medical procedures without a qualified surgeon, and a complete disregard for all sanitation in any situation. One member of the group will be the Ghastly Mutated or GM. The GM will be responsible for running the game and ensuring the group is tried and tested before facing the horrid creature of the same name.

This book will outline rules for the players, referred to as the Mutated, this will provide information for creating a character, the key rules of the game, and a menagerie of specimens detailing various Body Parts they can look forward to carelessly binding to themselves. Following this will be more about the world of Chimaera, horrors, mysteries, wildness and all. To close are the notes for the GM, this will contain suggestions for how to run the game, tips on how to design a session, as well as a heaving mound of gory tools to aid in the whole process.

## What Does A Session Look Like?

A group of friends will each create a Mutated creature that they will play during a session. The GM will play the many beasts and hazards that the Mutated will encounter. Play will see players collecting Body Parts, throwing away broken ones and gaining all sorts of defects and issues. The Mutated can engage in brawls, espionage, politics, crawl through caves to fight evil slugs, or brave frigid mountains plagued with blizzards.

A usual session will see the Mutated asked to help with a problem plaguing their Habitat. Upon further investigation the Mutated will need to overcome dangerous weather, crazy creatures and unhelpful citizens. The source of the problem will be the Ghastly Mutated, a dangerous beast with overwhelming mutagenic power. The Mutated may attempt to bring an end to the Ghastly Mutated, either defeating it in glory or failing and cowering away licking their wounds.

The Mutated will engage in mischievous manoeuvres, brutal brawls and petty parties. The Mutated will meld new Body Parts to themselves, and then they will fight horrid beasts that will tear those Body Parts to shreds. The arsenal of the Mutated may look entirely different post-battle, as their Body Parts are forged through the fight.

# The Mind, Body and Mutation

## Wellbeing

A Mutated’s well being defines the general Attributes of your character, the physical, mental and social wellbeing of your character.

### Attributes

Attributes dictate the number of D6s rolled when using the attribute. They should range from 2 - 10.

#### Mutability (MUT)

A measure of your ability to change and mutate your body and mind.

#### Psyche (PSY)

A Measure of your intelligence and understanding, as well as your prior knowledge.

#### Flexibility (FLX)

A Measure of your ability to contort your body or finesse in movement and fine motor skills.

#### Brutality (BRT)

A Measure of the raw physical strength you possess and your fierce demeanour

#### Durability (DRB)

A Measure of your resistance and endurance against metabolic challenges.

### Catabolism

Catabolism is a measure of your energy. Particularly extraneous Abilities will require the expenditure of Catabolic Points. Your Catabolic Points are refreshed at the conclusion of an Encounter.

> Clarification: Sometimes it is ambiguous when an Encounter has concluded. Some examples may be, Once you have ended hostilities with a hoard of foes. Or you have successfully completed a heist and are safe at home. Or exploited the entirety of a facility. Consult the GM as to whether you can refresh your Catabolic Points.

### Body Parts

The Mutated must connect limbs, organs, skin, teeth, and bone to their Body in order to become an effective killer, negotiator, explorer and beast hunter. Body Parts will grant the Mutated special abilities which will allow them to pull off fantastic tricks, daring feats, and dangerous maneuvers. This is achieved by Activating  the Body Part which allows you to execute any of the Abilities on the Body Part provided you can pay the cost in Catabolic Points or satisfy any triggers.

Having multiple Body Parts means that the Mutated will have more Abilities in their arsenal. It also increases the amount of Damage they can take as each Body Part has the 4 levels of Disrepair which are tracked individually. Any enemy creature has to reduce all the Mutated’s Body Parts to Broken before they can target the Body, and thus Defeat them. Similarly enemy creatures with more Body Parts are difficult to defeat as they also will have more Abilities, and can take more Damage.

The maximum number of Body Parts the Mutated can have is equal to the DRB Attribute.

## Mutating Yourself

In order to change your attributes you will need to acquire a Serum that can splice DNA. A single vial of this Serum allows you to do one of the following:

- Increase one Attribute by 1.
- Decrease one Attribute by 1, increase another by 2
- Gain an Additional 3 Catabolic Points.

## Character Creation

1. Grab or Print a Body Board
    1.1. Randomly select 3 Body Parts.
    1.2. Keep 1 Body Part and discard the other 2 Body Parts.
2. Distribute the following scores for each Attribute: 2, 2, 3, 3, 4.
3. Roll 3d6, the highest result will be your max Catabolic Points.
4. Determine your Predator & Prey
    4.1. Predator is something your creature fears, it can be a literal creature that is hunting them, it can be an event from their past, or it could be a faction they don’t get along with. Either way this is something that your creature is attempting to avoid.
    4.2. Prey is something your creature is attempting to achieve, it could be an item they are trying to get, a status within the community, or it can be a literal creature they enjoy hunting.
    4.3. Some examples are in the tables Predator and Prey
5. Describe your relationship with the world
    5.1. This is how you see the world and how you interact with others external to your group. You can select one of the following under Relationships or you can make your own.

### Determine your Predator and your Prey

#### Predator

Something your creature fears, it can be a literal creature that is hunting them, it can be an event from their past, or it could be a faction they don’t get along with. Either way this is something that your creature is attempting to avoid.

#### Prey

Something your creature is attempting to achieve, it could be an item they are trying to get, a status within the community, or it can be a literal creature they enjoy hunting.

### Describe your relationship with the world

This is how you see the world and how you interact with the others external to your group. You can select one of the following in the table Symbiosis or you can make your own.

#### Competition

Everything is a struggle to achieve as people vye for power, resources and strength. Everyone is responsible for their own success, and you struggle to rely on others, because you know deep down that everything has its price.

#### Mutualism

You believe that what you give to the world comes back. People are genuinely helpful and if by the end of the day if you have helped benefit someone, tomorrow will be a good day for you. You are concerned with other people's well being just as others are concerned with yours. You hope that through mutually beneficial relationships the world will prosper.

#### Commensalism

You are not one to draw attention to yourself. You work in the background ensuring that you can succeed at your goals, provided that you don’t impact others. You’ll take help where you can, and take advantage of each opportunity given to you. The world doesn’t owe you anything and you're well aware.

#### Parasitism

Your success is your success, other people's success are yours as well. People are tools for you to manipulate. As long as you have achieved your goals you care little about the harm that has come to others. You're not evil, just realistic. The world won't give you a second chance, so any benefit you can draw from it, is justified.

#### Amensalism

The world is inherently a bad place. All it ever does is harm you and everyone is indifferent to the suffering of others. You wish to change the world for the better, and it will be a hard uphill battle to fix it.

#### Mimicry

You're a master of symbiosis. The world isn’t good or bad, it's only built of relationships that harm or benefit you. You will change your attitudes and mannerisms to best suit your environment.

## Breaking the Body

### Disrepair

Each Body Part that you collect can become Broken, as it is used, fought with and damaged. Each time a Body Part takes Damage it increases its Disrepair from Fine, Scarred, Sceptic and Broken. Each level of Disrepair may result in a possible debuff.

#### Fine

The Body Part functions normally and is at full health

#### Scarred

The Body Part is still functioning but appears bruised and cut.

#### Sceptic

The Body Part is heavily damaged puss seeping from deep wounds. Roll your DRB, on a Partial Fail Roll on the Malfunctions Table.

#### Broken

The Body Part no longer works and rests limp on your body. If you succeeded or didn't take the roll during the Sceptic disrepair do the following: Subtract your MUT from your DRB, and roll that many dice to a minimum of 1. On a Partial Fail roll on the Malfunctions Table.

#### Special States of Disrepair

Some Abilities will allow for the following special states of Disrepair. For example if you continue to damage a Broken Body Part then it will become Obliterated, Or if you Super Succeed some attacks, you will be able to Sever the Body Part.

##### Obliterated

The Body Part is completely destroyed, it cannot be healed and is no longer attached to the Body. It can’t be picked up and used. It is now bloody mush on the floor.

##### Severed

The Body Part is torn off from the Body. It flies in the air and lands at your feet. Will you claim it for immediate use? When the Body Part is Severed it will fly in the air to the creature that severed it. They can then spend an Action to take the Metamorphosis Ability, to attach the severed piece at the Scarred disrepair level.

> If playing with body part cards, the orientation of the cards will correspond to the level of disrepair:
> Alternate with Paperclips

### Defeat

A creature is Defeated if all of its Body is reduced to a disrepair or Broken. All the Body Parts must be reduced to at least Broken in order to be able to target the Body.

### Revival

A creature can be revived through a special ritual. When you are Defeated you are no longer targeted for attack, but can be dismembered and used for parts. If there are no allies nearby you may never be revived, doomed to be torn apart. However if your allies survive a battle that you were killed in they are able to revive you upon the fight's conclusion. In order to do this  they must collect a variety of parts and reassemble you in a ritual that takes 5 hours. As the ritual proceeds you take the Metamorphosis Ability for each part that you attach.

# Socialising

Socialising describes play outside of combat, and will involve roleplay and decision making. During this time Body Parts can be Activated at any time and there isn't a strict Turn order. Catabolic Points are still tracked during socialising so creatures should be mindful how much energy they expend until the end of the Encounter.

## What does Socialising look like?

Socialising will usually include lower stakes interaction, such as bartering for Body Parts and Tools in a market. Discussing routes, weather and threats with the local guide of a town. It can also include high stakes non-combative encounters. These include attempting to steal a bespoke jewel from a store, investigating an incident on the streets, or attempting to sneak and lie your way into a facility. These interactions will require precise use of the Mutatedâ€™s Abilities and management of Catabolic Points to ensure the group can successfully pull off the mission.

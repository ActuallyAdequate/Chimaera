# Conditions

Conditions are effects which complicate, restrict or endanger the Mutated, they change the Mutated's behaviour, and how they interact with others and the environment. Conditions can be applied to the Mutated through certain Abilities, the Environment or the Weather.

When a condition is applied read the description of the condition. Some conditions have a delay before the effects are realised, others inhibit Particular Body Systems, meaning that no Body Part of that system can be Activated, while some control how the Mutated move or act.

## When is a Condition Cleared

A condition is cleared when the entity causing the condition ceases. If a Creature is causing the Condition such as in Frightened or Charmed, then the condition will end at the start of their next turn. Other conditions such as Burning or Acidic will end when the fire or acid is removed. Some conditions such a Boiling and Freezing can be caused by the weather, and so will be cleared when the weather event ends.

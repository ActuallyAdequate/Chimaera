# Conditions

## Frightened

Your Focus changes to what is causing the Frightened condition. If you are within Near of the source of the Fright, you must spend your next Action getting to a distance of Distant using any Ability. If you are already Distant, you must turn so they are behind you.

## Confused

You must Activate a Random Body Part and execute the Abilities. You ignore the tags of the Ability.

## Freezing

You only have a single Action per Turn rather than the regular two.

## Boiling

Every Ability that costs CP costs double CP.

## Awe

Your Focus changes to what is causing the Awe condition. If you are not at least Close to the source of the Awe you will use any Body Part to get closer and turn toward it.

## Repulsed

Your Focus changes to yourself, and if you are Near or closer to what is causing Repulsion you must spend your next Action getting to a distance of Distant using any Ability. If you are the source of the Repulsion you will try to end the Repulsion, e.g. moving toward water, or hiding.

## Prone

When a creature is Prone, they cannot execute any Abilities that require physical movement unless they spend an Action to get back up, they can still do any other Action. The Prone condition lasts until the creature uses its Action or React to get up.

## Restrained

A creature is Restrained for as long as whatever is Restraining them continues to Restrain them. The creature Restrained is unable to execute any Abilities that require physical movement until they can successfully make a BRT or FLX roll to escape as an Action. The Restrainer may activate other Body Parts (if it is a creature and not rope) but then the Restrain condition will immediately end.

## Blind

A creature that is Blind is unable to see until the condition ends.

## Deafened

A creature that is Deafened is unable to hear anything until the condition ends.
Inhibited
This condition applies to specific Body Parts. An inhibited Body Part canâ€™t be Activated until the condition ends.

## Poisoned

At the beginning of your next Turn roll a number of dice equal to the Poisoner's MUT. You take as much Internal Damage as there are 6s.

## Alight

When you gain the Alight condition choose a Body Part that becomes on fire. When this Condition would normally end (at the end of your first Action) that Body Part takes 2 Internal Damage. Then roll your DRB. On a Partial Fail the fire moves to a different Body Part. This continues until you put the fire out. (Such as using water). You can always put a fire out by using an Action to roll on the ground, in this case roll FLX and on a Success or better the Alight condition ends.

## Bleeding

At the beginning of your next Turn lose a number of Catabolic Points equal to your MUT.

# Conditions

Conditions are continuous issues that effect creatures. A condition is executed before a React, or before the creature's first Action on their turn. Conditions will remain until cleared with the _Get Yourself Together_ Action.

## Frightened

Your Focus changes immediately to what is causing you to be Frightened. If you are within Near of the source of the Fright, you must get to a distance of Distant using any Ability. If you are already Distant, you must turn, so they are behind you.

## Confused

You must Activate a Random Body Part and execute the Abilities. You ignore the tags of the Ability.

## Freezing

You only have a single Action this Turn rather than the regular two.

## Boiling

Every Ability that costs CP costs double CP.

## Awe

Your Focus changes to what is causing the Awe. If you are not at least Close to the source of the Awe you will use any Body Part to get closer and turn toward it.

## Repulsed

Your Focus changes to yourself, and if you are within Near to what is causing the Repulsion you must get to a distance of Distant using any Ability. If you are the source of the Repulsion you will try to end the Repulsion, e.g. clean yourself, or hiding.

## Prone

When a creature is Prone, they cannot execute any Abilities that require physical movement. They can still do any other Action. You may use a React to clear this condition.

## Restrained

The creature Restrained is unable to execute any Abilities that require physical movement until they can successfully make a BRT or FLX roll to escape as an Action, This condition can't be cleared using _Get Yourself Together_. The Restrainer may activate other Body Parts (if it is a creature and not rope) but then the Restrained condition will immediately end.

## Blind

A creature that is Blind is unable to see.

## Deafened

A creature that is Deafened is unable to hear anything.

## Inhibited

This condition applies to specific Body Parts. An inhibited Body Part canâ€™t be Activated.

## Poisoned

At the beginning of your turn roll a number of dice equal to the Poisoner's MUT. You take as much Internal Damage as there are 1s.

## Alight

When you gain the Alight condition choose a Body Part that becomes on fire. At the beginning of your turn the Body Part takes 2 Internal Damage. Then roll your DRB. On a Partial Fail the fire moves to a different Body Part. (This counts as having two separate Alight Conditions, that must be individually cleared with _Get Yourself Together_)

## Bleeding

At the beginning of your next turn lose a number of Catabolic Points equal to your MUT.

## Suffocating

At the beginning of your turn roll a number of dice equal to your PSY. You take as much Internal Damage as there are 1s.

# Habitat

The mutated belong to a habitat, this is what the group share and should protect. It is the uniting force that will bring the pack together to face off against the Ghastly Mutated that threatens there environment and their homes. The habitat can simply be a shared ecology and land that the mutated belong to, such as a jungle, or a region in the mountains. The habitat could be more specific, such as a den, or a colony.

## Defining the Habitat

The mutated begin their habitat by settling in a new place, which will be the home of the group. As a group you may decide on some characteristics of the Habitat:

- The weather
- The biome
- The flora and fauna
- The geography

Often when establishing your habitat you will need to exterminate, scare away or somehow else deal with a Ghastly Mutated that is taking residence their. This is often the first expedition the mutated will go on, and later expedition will see the mutated help nearby colonies, defending their habitat from more dangerous Ghastly Mutated, or exploring to find new creatures, and items for their habitat.

## Growing the Habitat

In addition to the habitat being the centre of operations for the Mutated and a safe place to return, the Habitat can be expanded and improved over the course of multiple adventures. When the Mutated meet intelligent creatures they may be able to recruit them to join and take residence in the habitat. These recruits can provide services for the Mutated, such as crafting tools, providing exploration plans and maps, sourcing body parts, or establish relationships with other colonies. Members of the habitat may also ask for help from the Mutated, and may become unhappy or leave the habitat if mistreated.

### Upgrade Cost

In order to upgrade the habitat you need to spend all 7 resources in the track. These upgrades can be spent on different structures to support the habitat. Habitats require upgrades to support more creatures which can offer services and expeditions. Below is a list of ideas for upgrades that could be made to the habitat, and the type of services they can provide. Many Buildings will require a creature to work in them to be functional.

- **Foundations:** Clear difficult or unstable terrain.
- **Den/Nest:** Allow 3 more creatures to be recruited to habitat.
- **Butcher:** Sells Body Parts.
- **Perch:** Provides early warning of attacks on the habitat.
- **Bureau of Meteorology:** Provides exploration planning for weather.
- **Cartographer:** Provides exploration planning for Geography.
- **Embassy:** Supports relationships with nearby colonies.
- **Workshop:** Sells Tools and Gear.
- **Surgeon Theatre:** Heals Body Parts.
- **Hunting Ground:** Trains Creatures to Defend or Mercenary for Hire.
- **Comedy Club:** Provides Entertainment.

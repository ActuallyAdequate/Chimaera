# Environment

Environment is a critical component of Chimaera. Not only are the horrid mutated beasts a threat, but so are the forests, the rains, the storms, and lands. The environment that an Encounter takes place can affect the difficulty of fighting, moving, and executing Abilities.

Environment includes Weather and Events. Certain combinations of Weather will result in particular Events, while other Events occur randomly. Each Event may give creatures adverse Conditions or cause creatures to move in certain ways or take Damage. Some Events or the consequences of those Events can be ignored if the creature has access to certain Abilities. (These Abilities do not need to be executed in order to be able to ignore the effects of the Event, this also means Tools will not be damaged when used to ignore an Event’s effects.)

# Environment

Not only are the horridly mutated beasts a threat, but so are the forests, the rains, the storms, and lands. The environment that an Encounter takes place can affect the difficulty of fighting, moving, and executing Abilities.

## Weather

The weather of Chimaera is volatile, each encounter the weather may change, and the most dangerous weather will threaten the Mutated. Weather is driven by the season, which will dictate the severe weather events. Additionally, there may be other random weather or environmental events.

## When Hazards are Granted

Hazards can be granted for any particularly challenging Activity. This may be a challenging Social Encounter, where you need to lie, persuade or threaten another creature. It may be a tough environmental encounter, where you have to navigate tricky paths, or traverse unstable formations. Hazards can be granted for difficult problem-solving, or finding hidden clues.

## Spending Hazards

The GM can choose any time to spend Hazards to make the Mutated's situation more dangerous. They may spend them immediately after being granted to create a drawback to the current Action, or save them for a later time to introduce complications to another encounter.

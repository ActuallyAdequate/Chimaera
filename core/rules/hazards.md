# Hazards

The world of Chimaera is a dangerous place, and sometimes when executing Actions the Mutated may not be able to succeed without a cost.

The GM may call that a particular Action is Challenging, In this case the GM may gain a Hazard which they can spend to introduce complications or accidents which put the Mutated in precarious positions.

The Mutated is left with a choice. They can either fail the Action preventing the GM from getting a Hazard, or press their luck and Succeed the challenged Action, but possibly grant the GM the Hazard.

## Resolving a Challenge

If the Mutated decide to press on in the face of a Challenge, they must draw the bottom card from the deck of Body Part Cards. If the number of bone fragments on the broken side of the Card is greater than the number of Body Parts in the limb that was Activated for that Action. Then the challenge is passed, and the GM is not given a Hazard. If the number of bone fragments is less than the number of Body Parts the challenge fails. The Mutated still achieve what they wanted to, but the GM is granted a Hazard.

>[!INFO]
> This represents how limbs with fewer Body Parts, while being able to do less are more potent in their focus and therefor can succeed more often

## When is Something Challenging?

Hazards can be granted for any particularly challenging Activity. This may be a challenging Social Encounter, where you need to lie, persuade or threaten another creature. It may be a tough environmental encounter, where you have to navigate tricky paths, or traverse unstable formations. Hazards can be granted for difficult problem-solving, or finding hidden clues. Any activity that could fail, and isn't granted directly from a Body Part may be considered challenging.

## Spending Hazards

The GM can choose any time to spend Hazards to make the Mutated's situation more dangerous. They may spend them immediately after being granted to create a drawback to the current Action, or save them for a later time to introduce complications to another encounter, such as changing the Weather, Ambushes, or causing some other dangerous event.

## Succeed Abilities

Some Abilities state that the Mutated Succeed at a particular activity. When the Mutated do this Activity it never grants a Hazard no matter how challenging it is.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This does not mean that any activity is possible, something may just be impossible, such as trying to persuade an enraged monster to donate their limbs to you. But if something would be challenging such as threatening a creature to take you to their lair, you would be able to succeed without the challenge.

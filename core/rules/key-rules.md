# Everything you Need to Know

## The Body

Your Body is the base for the rest of your Body Parts. As long as you have your Body you will be alive and well. Your Body will provide you with the ability to Metamorphose to attach new Body Parts. Your Body Parts grant you access to specialised Abilities.

## Rolling

When asked to Roll you will do so based on the requested number of 6 sided Dice (d6). If you roll at least one 6 that is a Success, on no 6s it is a Partial Fail and if more than half of the dice are a 6 it is a Super Success.
The minimum number of dice that can be rolled is 1. If you are requested to roll less than 1 dice, roll 1 die instead.

## Attributes

Attributes are the general statistics of the Mutated. These include Mutability, Brutality, Flexibility, Psyche, and Durability. Each will have a value that determines the number of dice to roll when using the attribute. Attributes are used when resolving challenging activities, or activating Abilities.

## Abilities

Abilities are special powers that the Mutated can gain through their Body Parts. These can make you a more effective killer, adventurer or manipulator. Abilities include unique specialised skills and will often ask for a roll to be made to determine the result of using the ability. The ability will specify what occurs on a Success, Super Success or Partial Fail.

## Difficulty

Some activities are harder than others. When completing a particularly difficult task the GM may set a higher than usual Difficulty which will cause a certain amount of dice to be removed from your hand before you Roll for the outcome.

## Damage, Disrepair and Defeat

Damage is represented by a number which will reduce the targeted Body Part by that many Disrepair Levels. When the Body Part becomes Broken it can no longer be used. Your Body cannot be Damaged until all of your Body Parts are Broken. If your Body becomes Broken you will be Defeated.

## Focus

Focus is used to describe what a creature is paying attention to. When a creature is focussed on something it will be aware of what is occurring and any abilities being used. A creature will automatically be Focussed on either the last creature that attacked it or someone it is attacking, or someone or something that it can Sense.

Sometimes creatures will be made to lose Focus on something, usually due to them changing Focus. Some examples are below.

> A guard changes focus to a brawl on the streets thus allowing the party to sneak behind them.
A creature becomes in Awe of another thus changing focus from one creature to another. The other creature is now able to Hide In Plain Sight as they are no longer being Focussed on by anyone.

## Distance and Direction

Sometimes an Ability will require the Mutated to be a certain distance from the opposing creature. Or a Body Part providing defence will only protect in a particular direction.

There are five Distances: Afar, Distant, Near, Close and Personal. In general Personal is occupying the same space, Close is within melee distance, Near is within walking distance and Distant is within running distance, and Afar within shooting range.

In addition there are four Direction: Front, Left, Right, Back, which determine on which side of you an opposing creature may be.

### Falling

When falling you will take a certain amount of Damage depending on the Distance you fall with nothing to break your fall, as per the following:
Close: 0-2 Damage
Near: 3 - 8 Damage
Distant: 9 -16 Damage
Afar: 17-28 Damage
Half the damage will be dealt as Physical Damage, the other half dealt as Internal Damage.

> #### Mind And Matter
>
> This method of Distance and Direction aims to facilitate minatureless play, allowing for somewhat streamlined theatre of mind play. If instead you wish to run a game with miniatures to showcase some wacky and horrifying creatures the Distances and Directions can be adapted as follows:
>
> Playing on square grid the distances translate to the following number of squares:
>
> - **Afar:** Within 24 Spaces
> - **Distant:** Within 12 Spaces
> - **Near:** Within 6 Spaces
> - **Close:** Within 1 Space
> - **Personal:** Occupying Same Space
>
> The Directions work by extending lines at 45 degree angles from the location of the creature. If falling between the lines then you are on that side of the creature, if you are on the 45 degree line then you have visibility of two sides.

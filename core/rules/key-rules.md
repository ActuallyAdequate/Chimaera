# Everything you Need to Know

## The Body

Your Body is the base for the rest of your Body Parts. As long as you have your Body you will be alive and well. Your Body will provide you with the ability to Metamorphose to attach new Body Parts. Your Body Parts grant you access to specialised Abilities.

## Rolling

When asked to Roll you will do so based on the requested number of 6 sided Dice (d6). If you roll at least one 6 that is a Success, on no 6s it is a Partial Fail and if more than half of the dice are a 6 it is a Super Success.
The minimum number of dice that can be rolled is 1. If you are requested to roll less than 1 dice, roll 1 die instead.

## Attributes

Attributes are the general statistics of the Mutated. These include Mutability, Brutality, Flexibility, Psyche, and Durability. Each will have a value that determines the number of dice to roll when using the attribute. Attributes are used when resolving challenging activities, or activating Abilities.

## Abilities

Abilities are special powers that the Mutated can gain through their Body Parts. These can make you a more effective killer, adventurer or manipulator. Abilities include unique specialised skills and will often ask for a roll to be made to determine the result of using the ability. The ability will specify what occurs on a Success, Super Success or Partial Fail.

## Difficulty

Some activities are harder than others. When completing a particularly difficult task the GM may set a higher than usual Difficulty which will cause a certain amount of dice to be removed from your hand before you Roll for the outcome.

## Damage, Disrepair and Defeat

Damage is represented by a number which will reduce the targeted Body Part by that many Disrepair Levels. When the Body Part becomes Broken it can no longer be used. Your Body cannot be Damaged until all of your Body Parts are Broken. If your Body becomes Broken you will be Defeated.

## Focus

Focus is used to describe what a creature is paying attention to. When a creature is focussed on something it will be aware of what is occurring and any abilities being used. A creature will automatically be Focussed on either the last creature that attacked it or someone it is attacking, or someone or something that it can Sense.

Sometimes creatures will be made to lose Focus on something, usually due to them changing Focus. Some examples are below.

> A guard changes focus to a brawl on the streets thus allowing the party to sneak behind them.
A creature becomes in Awe of another thus changing focus from one creature to another. The other creature is now able to Hide In Plain Sight as they are no longer being Focussed on by anyone.

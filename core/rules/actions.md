# Actions

Play is broken down into Actions. Whenever the Mutated want to complete a task, such as attacking a creature, climbing a cliff face, or manipulating a colonist, they must do so using Actions. An Action requires a goal (the thing the Mutated is trying to do), a limb (the Body Parts the Mutated will Activate), and a description of how the set of connected Body Parts will achieve the goal.

## Action Goals

Below are some examples of Action Goals:

- Attacking a creature
- Damaging a group of creatures at once
- Convincing a towns' person to do something
- Setting up a trap
- Traversing a hazardous bridge

## Actions and Body Parts

To execute the action you must Activate a Limb. All Body Parts that are a member of the limb are Activated. The player must then describe how the Mutated use all the connected Body Parts to achieve the goal.

> Imagine a creature with a Poison Gland Body Part, and their task is to poison a tyrant. There are different ways that this could be achieved depending on how the Body Parts are connected.
> **The Poison Gland is Attached directly to the Body:** The Mutated could Activate to squeeze some poison out onto some food.
>
> **The Poison Gland is Attached to Cheetah Legs which are directly Attached to the Body:** The Mutated could activate the legs to sprint across a hallway, and within the same Action leave a poison trail.
>
> **The Poison Gland is Attached to the Body, and Cheetah Legs are attached to the Poison Gland:** The Mutated Activate the Gland which produces little rolling globules that can travel the distance of the cheetah legs.
>
> **Wings are Attached to the Body, Bristles are Attached to the Wings and the Poison Gland is Attached to the Bristles:** The Mutated Activate the Wings, flying high, then shoot their bristles into the creature and inject poison into it's blood stream all in one Action.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Notice how the order of the Body Parts effect the way the action is resolved. When the Cheetah Legs are Activated, the action is modified by the Poison Gland by leaving a trail behind. However, when it is the Poison Gland that is directly connected to the Body, the action is modified by the Cheetah Legs resulting in rolling globules of poison.

## Activating Body Parts

![Body Part Attachments](../media/body_part_attachement.svg)

- The Body Parts 1-4 are Body Parts that can be Activated as they are directly attached to the Body.
- The Body Parts 5-7 are connected to other Body Parts and so are Activated indirectly.
- Activating Body Part 4 doesn't Activate any other Body Parts.
- Activating Body Part 2 will also Activate Body Part 7
- Activating Body Part 1 will also Activate Body Part 4 and 5

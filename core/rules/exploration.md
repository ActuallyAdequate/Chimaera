# Exploration

Exploration occurs when attempting to navigate to new lands, find facilities, or track down the Ghastly Mutated. The group will decide what their goal is, such as search for a location or creature or journey to a known town. During their travel the group will be interrupted by an unknown number (decided by the GM) of encounters. These may include being ambushed by a predator, navigating through difficult terrain or blocked passages, or braving dangerous weather.

## Overcoming an interruption

When faced with an encounter while exploring, the GM will frame what is occurring and the current state of the group. As the mutated, you should describe how you overcome the challenge, whether using teamwork, Body Parts and Abilities, or one of your Attributes. You will then execute or roll to determine whether the group completes the Encounter successfully. The encounter may devolve into combat, socialising or require more or different solutions if the first attempt fails.

## Preventing Interruptions

In order to reduce the challenges encountered while exploring, the Mutated should prepare themselves for exploration. This can occur by consulting guides or maps so they know where they are going and don't get lost. They should discuss what environment or weather they may encounter. What creatures roam the area if any. The more prepared the group is the less likely interruptions will occur, or fail.

# Environment

Not only are the creatures of Chimaera dangerous and horrid but so to is the environment. The environment of Chimaera is chaotic, the weather inhospitable, the terrain impenetrable.

## Ecosystem

Each encounter takes place in an ecosystem, the ecosystem refers to the flora and fauna present and how they interact. Sometimes an Ecosystem is peaceful, sometime alive and vibrant, other times nothing but hostile. The GM can spend Hazards to increase the Ecosystem's Hostility, causing it to evolve. See the GM section for examples of Ecosystems

## Weather

Each encounter may also be subject to extreme weather. Weather often grants conditions that effect what creatures are able to do. The weather changes randomly for each encounter, however, the GM is able to spend Hazards to move the weather to greater extremes. See the GM section for Weather change.

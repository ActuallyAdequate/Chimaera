# Turns

The Mutated's turn encapsulates their behaviour during a short amount of time. Each Creature and the Mutated in play should alternate turns to ensure that each Creature has an opportunity to play.

## How many Actions

Every Creature including the Mutated have 1 Action on their turn. This means that they select 1 Limb to Activate its Body Parts.

## When to use a Strict Turn Order

When playing Chimaera it may be beneficial to follow a strict turn order in particular situations, such as tense movements, combat, or exploration.

When doing so Creature with the highest number of 'thought' body Parts should go first, this represents their mental alertness to situations. Use the 'muscular' body system as a tiebreaker which represents the creatures reflexes to situations. In case of another tie then the order is decided by the GM.

>[!NOTE]
> Sometimes creatures will ambush the Mutated. In this case an exception to the turn order may be made ensuring the creatures ambushing go first as they were able to surprise the Mutated.

# Turns

The Mutated's turn encapsulates their behaviour during a short amount of time. Each Creature and the Mutated in play should alternate turns to ensure that each Creature has an opportunity to play.

## How many Actions

Every Creature including the Mutated have 2 Actions on their turn. This means that the select 1 Body Party to Activate and resolve all subsequent Body Parts, Then once resolved, they select 1 Other Body Part to Activate, and Activate all Other Body Parts.

You can select any Body Parts that are attached directly to the Body as per the Activation rules, which will also Activate all attached Body Parts. You can Activate the same Body Parts twice.

## When to use a Strict Turn Order

When playing Chimaera it may be beneficial to follow a strict turn order in particular situations, such as tense movements, combat, or exploration.

When doing so Creature with the highest number of 'thought' body Parts should go first, this represents their mental alertness to situations. Use the 'muscular' body system as a tiebreaker which represents the creatures reflexes to situations. In case of another tie then order decided by the GM holds.

>[!NOTE]
> Sometimes creatures will ambush the Mutated. In this case an exception to the turn order may be made ensuring the creatures ambushing go first as they were able to surprise the Mutated.

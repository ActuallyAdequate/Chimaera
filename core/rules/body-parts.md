# Body Parts

Each Body Part has three elements which describe its behaviour.

1. **Body System:** The Body System it belongs to.
2. **Disrepair:** The Disrepair of the Body Part.
3. **Description:** A description of the Body Part that can be used to help describe how it is used in an Action.
4. **Abilities:** Descriptions of how the body part interacts with rules such as movement, Injuries and Conditions.

## Key Terms

### Reach

Reach specify the distance that a Body Part's Ability effects. Such as being able to launch something to a distance of Near. Or Spikes reaching a distance of Personal Space. This means that the target must be within that distance to be affected.

Attaching a Body Part to another Body Part inherits that Reach of the Body Part it is attached to, unless the attached Body Part also specifies its own Reach. For example Attaching a Body Part that doesn't specify its own Reach will have the default reach of the Body of Close. But if it specifies its own Reach such as Personal Space then it has a Reach of Personal Space.

### Succeed

When an Ability says you Succeed at a particular activity this means you can do so without being challenged as per the Hazard rules.

### Grant and Ignore Conditions

Some Abilities grant conditions on other creatures. When Activated the target will gain the Condition according to the Conditions rules

Ignoring Conditions is done continuously and doesn't require Activating the Body Part. When a Condition would be applied to you that you can Ignore. Then you don't have the Condition.

### Take and Deal an Injury

When Dealing an Injury choose which Body Part of the Target you would like to attack, then increase its Disrepair by the amount of Injuries dealt.

When Taking and Injury choose which of your Body Parts takes the Injury, and increase its Disrepair by the amount of Injuries dealt.

Some Body Part allows you to ignore 1 more injuries of a certain type either Physical or Internal. This allows you to reduce the number of Injuries taken each time you are targeted by another's Action. For example if a Creature Activates two Body Parts, That are part of a limb, that both Deal 1 Physical Damage, and you have a Body Part that allows you to Ignore 1 Physical Damage. Then You will only take 1 Physical Damage.

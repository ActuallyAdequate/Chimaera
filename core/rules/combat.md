# Combat

Combat occurs when the group must use violence to achieve their goals. This is when they will often get wounded and wound other creatures. Combat is the most ordered part of the game requiring turn orders and precise use of abilities depending on the stage of combat. Combat begins in three ways, either an individual deals or takes damage, the attack is expected such as negotiations gone awry or after a surprise attack.

## Beginning Combat

Once combat is about to begin each player will determine turn order, The player with the highest PSY attribute will be first and then others in descending order. If there's a tie then the players can discuss who goes before the other.

> ### Beginning Combat with Surprise
>
> If combat is initiated on a group of unaware creatures. The attacking group will be granted surprise. Each creature granted surprise is given a single Action (As opposed to the usual 2) to commit before beginning combat normally. If a React is granted then the surprise round ends early as the creature who is Reacting alerts its allies. In this case the order of combat starts with the creature that first initiated surprise and then follows the usual order using PSY.

## Turn Phases

A Turn is made of 2 Actions and a React
For each Action the player will Activate one of their Body Parts, allowing them to execute any Abilities with the Action tag. The player can’t Activate the same Body Part twice on their Turn.

Depending on the outcomes of each Action, the opposition may be granted a React. Only one React is granted per Turn even if both Actions result in granting a React. It is possible for the same opposing creature to have multiple Reacts granted by different players’ Turns.

Some Abilities rather than being activated as an Action are activated when some Trigger occurs. These can occur at any time, whether inbetween Turns, during an Action or before a React. When the Trigger occurs the ability is immediately resolved and then the Action or React is carried out from the point it was interrupted.

## Dealing Damage

Most of the time when you deal Damage you choose what Body Part you are attacking. You cannot target the enemy's Body until all their Body Parts are at least Broken. When the Body is broken the enemy is Defeated.

## Reacts

Often Reacts are granted when an Action Partially Fails. Each player's Turn can only grant 1 React. Reacts always occur after both actions of the player whose turn it is, is completed, even if the React is granted on the first action. This also means that a player may use there second action to negate the React that will come after it, such as running away on their second action to avoid a melee reaction.

When executing a React, the rules for Partial Fail may change. If the Partial Fail would grant a React it does not, instead the React Fails and nothing occurs (This means if a Partial Fail would usually deal 1 Damage and grant another React, it instead deals No Damage and No React is granted).

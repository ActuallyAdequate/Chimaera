# Chimaera

Chimaera is a hack and slash role-playing game set in an alternate world, where instead of fighting with sword and shield or casting magic, one must mutate their body with all manner of crude biological weaponry. Tack on extra limbs and become the arachnid monstrosity. Alter your brain and become a psychological freak. Will you tear through your enemies claiming their parts into a mound of trophies worn on your back, or will you carefully select what parts are sanitary to become a keen and precise instrument of death?

## Playing Chimaera

In order to play, one will need a group, most of which will be willing to undergo medical procedures without a qualified surgeon and a complete disregard for all sanitation in any situation. One member of the group will be the Ghastly Mutated or GM. The Ghastly Mutated will be responsible for running the game and ensuring the group is tried and tested before facing the horrid creature of the same name.

This book will outline rules for the players, referred to as the Mutated, this will provide information for creating a character, the key rules of the game, and a menagerie of data detailing various Body Parts they can look forward to careless binding to themselves. Following this are the notes for the GM, this will contain suggestions for how to run the game, tips on how to design a session or campaign, as well as a heaving mound of gory tools to aid in the whole process.

## What Does A Session Look Like?

A group of 2-6 friends (or enemies) will create a Mutated creature that they will play during a session. The GM will play the many adversaries and situations that the Mutated will encounter. Play will see players collecting Body Parts, throwing away broken ones and gaining all sorts of defects and issues. The Mutated can engage in brawls, espionage, politics, crawl through caves to fight evil slugs, or brave frigid mountains where frostbite causes their limbs to drop off.

A usual session will see the Mutated asked to help with a problem plaguing their Habitat. Upon further investigation the Mutated will need to overcome dangerous weather, crazy creatures and unhelpful citizens. The source of the problem will be the Ghastly Mutated, a dangerous beast with overwhelming mutagenic power. The Mutated may attempt to bring an end to the Ghastly Mutated, either defeating it in glory or failing and cowering away licking their wounds.

The Mutated will pull off amazing tricks, epic fights and nasty encounters. Just as the Mutated build their character from different Body Parts, they will fight horrid beasts that will tear those Body Parts to shreds. Combat will see the players grasping and fusing new Body Parts to overcome threats and Obliterate or Sever the Body Parts of the intimidating creatures they face. The arsenal of the Mutated may look entirely different post-battle, as their Body Parts are forged through the fight.

## Overview of Rules

The Mutated can build their character from Body Parts, these will allow the Mutated to access all sorts of specialised abilities, which can be used during combat, negotiations, or exploration. A player can activate a Body Part which will allow them to execute any of the Abilities granted by the Body Part.

Abilities require rolling a number of 6-sided dice (d6) equal to one of the core Attributes: Mutability, Brutality, Flexibility, Psyche, and Durability. When you make a roll the outcome will be a Success (one 6), Super Success (greater than half are 6s) or Partial Fail (no 6s). Depending on the outcome certain events will occur as specified by the Ability. Some Abilities require the use of Catabolic Points, which represent the energy of the Mutated. If you don’t have enough Catabolic Points you can’t execute the Ability.

If you get injured you will receive Damage. Damage increases the Disrepair of your Body Parts causing them to be Broken. You can’t use Body Parts that are Broken. If all your Body Parts are Broken your Body can start taking Damage. If your Body becomes Broken you are Defeated and must wait for a friend to repair you.

You can upgrade your Attributes, by finding Serum. The Serum allows you to increase an Attribute or gain more Catabolic Points.

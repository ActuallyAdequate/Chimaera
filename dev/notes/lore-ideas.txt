The World Of Chimaera

In the past, catastrophe struck the Earth. The cause is not quite known, but this brief period of time completely changed the trajectory of the world. The Earth’s temperature began to fluctuate constantly and rapidly, freezing winters would be preceded by intense heat waves only a day apart. Strong winds, enough to take down buildings would carry the freezing air making it nigh impossible to maintain farms. Ecosystems began to collapse along with their food chains. Seismic activity dramatically increased causing land masses to be torn apart, with constant earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Mass extinction events occurred across the globe, caused by famine, flood, and frenzy.

Riots burst out in every country to blame the Facilities. These Facilities were expansive research stations, where the elite researching conglomerates experimented in the fields of physics, quantum mechanics, biomedicine and chemistry. Particle colliders, dark matter detectors, satellite arrays, supercomputers, and nuclear generators were among the many large-scale equipment within the Facilities.

As billions of people died rioting, the uber-rich retreated to space ‘safe havens’ and the directors of the Facilities secured themselves in underground bunkers. A small charitable research community within the Facilities were the only ones you had not given up hope, not yet.

Every attempt to stabilise the Earth’s core and its environment had been met with roadblock after false start, after dead end. If the Earth could not be halted in its continual turmoil, then the only option left was to adapt. And so began a decade long endeavour to produce the Serum. This Serum encouraged the rapid resequencing of the genome, constructed from the few thriving species, and artificially spliced with pathogenic genomes. The researchers in their last ditch effort long after the radio frequencies had gone silent, released the Serum as a contagious disease.

In the present day, those researchers have disappeared from living and written history. But they were successful. Life on the Earth still persists today, but in no recognisable way from the perspective of the old precursor humans. Creatures are now mutants constructed from various animals’ body parts. The Facilities are either abandoned or home to Ghastly Mutated creatures you feed on vats of Serum. These creatures are formidable and abhorrent. Small communities, colonies and packs of creatures now make up small pockets of urbanised environments among the perilous wilderness. 

## The Truths of Chimaera

### Mutanism

The emergence of chaotic DNA, results in a world where creatures are highly biologically adaptable. Creatures are able to fuse with others resulting in new unexpected combinations. Predators are able to tear another creature apart and mutate by attaching the victims limbs to further evolve. Horrid creatures roam the uncharted lands. Creatures with unprecedented intelligence for strong and dependable communities.
Some creatures descend to become the Ghastly Mutated, they hoard Serum becoming stronger, smarter and highly mutable.


### Human Precursors

The world of Chimaera is set in a post-human setting. After the events of the great catastrophe much of humanity was extinct. However rumours of this precursor race still proliferate among the new settlements of Chimaera. Adventurers and scholars alike search and discover ancient structures, tools, and writings of the precursors.

### Intelligent Life

Most life is highly chaotic and ever changing, the environments range drastically more so than ever. Intelligent life still remains among the earth, with different factions, groups and leadership establishing their lands and power. Attitudes among these groups vary greatly however the underlying understanding of life is far different to what they once were.

### History
In the world of Chimaera it is up to you how long ago the great catastrophe was. Has it been only a few hundred years, new civilisations are forming, creatures are only just beginning to understand their new found power. Has it been a fair bit longer? Civilisations have risen and fallen, empires exist and are beginning to tame the chaotic world. Is the great catastrophe ancient history? Cities span the earth, globalism and nation trade are common and interconnected. How would these times in history be different to what they were before the great catastrophe? How do cities work when people can fly, swim or walk? How do civilizations function without the need for tools? 


### The Status Quo

**Mutanism is Common:** The act of modifying your body for different needs is not taboo. Farmer’s can often be seen changing out their hands for trowel-like appendages when harvest time comes. Similarly advanced combatants can be observed quickly metamorphosing their bodies to gain the advantage in a duel.

**Tools are no longer needed:** With the ease of biological modification most tools and weapons became redundant. With fewer people requesting such items the production and tradecraft ceased entirely. Tools are exceedingly rare. Someone using a tool over their biological systems is often met with confusion or whispers about their membership to fanatic anti-mutant groups.

**There are different Degrees of Mutanism: **Different creatures mutate differently. Some life when it was exposed by the great catastrophe, merely mutated once, and from then on remained in its mutated state unable to change.The majority of life established the ability to fuse with other parts, attaching new limbs, organs or senses. Rarely seen and the most exotic are those that have an intimate connection and control over their own DNA. Creatures like this are able to resequence their genome, allowing them to actively and quickly reshape their being into near whatever they want.

**The World is Untamed:** Most of the world is made up of dangerous environments, hostile weather and untamed wilderness. While there are settlements, they are few and far between. The settlements that do exist are often plagued with raids from other settlements and ambushes from terrifying creatures.

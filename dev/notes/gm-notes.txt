Need a bit about encouraging players to consider the order of their Body Parts (or perhaps this should be enforced.)

perhaps it is the GMs call if a strict order should be used..



HAZARDS

Need a bit on how and when Hazards should be granted and spent

Never for combat related ablities. Never for Abilities direclty granted through Body Parts
But Yes when trying ot justify an activity, even if it uses a Body Parts
Most often for social encounters, problem sovlign, exploration.


SUCEED
This is not a win all thing, THings are sometime still impossible, it just that if it is possible then ther is no challenge or Hazards
e.g. can;t persuade a creature you are fighting to give up theri body parts. (The creature would outright refuse or not listen)
But convincing a  creature to betray their friend in a fight may be possible (for the right price) and could be done so without challenge

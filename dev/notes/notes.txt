Gore:RPG Design Goals
Gore (Name to decided) is a hack and slash rpg that encourages both combat and deviousness. The key Gimmick is that instead of levels and linear progression to get new abilities, the players can modify their bodies to increase their key attributes, and get access to new abilities. THis game should have do first attitude, you can always do the thing you want, even if you ‘fail’, what happens instead is that some sort of consequence happens in addition.

The RPG is loosely based on the pbta system. In which characters have moves that they can take, these include things like combat, discussion, changing body parts and a whole lot more interesting things. When a move requires a roll, that roll usually results in 1 of 3 events. Complete Success, Partial Success (cost), COmplete Failure.
Body part switching and mutnaism is normed

Combat really simple based on rolling a bunch of D6s and getting the number of 6ix
Should be minatureless
Distance from enemy described as close, far and distant. Moving is simply changing from one distance to another. Or moving around the enemy to there sides or back or front. 

I WANT TO HAVE ENVIRONMENTS BE A BIT MORE OF A FOCUS THAN IT IS IN GAMES LIKE DND.
IS TI WINDY OR RAINY HOW DOES THAT EFFECT THE CHARACTERS AND THERE ABILITIES.

Exhaustion????
Character sheet app and dm app for help managing stats and shit.
 Tails attack with FLX

Brains have lobes and the number is determined by potency of torso. bUild brain form different lobes. Lobes can only be gathered from living creatures, either by restraining? Or defeating. If killed you cant get the lobes.
Issues
I dislike the sense slots and organ slots.
Could replace with can have a number equal to PSY And MUT respectively
However what is the point of The Head body part.
Is head what determines brain? -> MOUTH
Is Brain an organ and so need organ slot to then get sense spots
What if no brain? Does that mean no sense.
May need to change how combining sizes work 
Should be just those listed
OR can you use one smaller and one larger
At the moment a medium creature can use a caterpillar torso as that torso has a size of tiny or small thus a medium creature could use it. IS this bad?

There is no real way of upgrading. So many moves should incorporate yourattrirbutes so they get more powerful if you upgrade your attributes.

Mutability may be is how effective your parts are??
Exploring
Combination Of skill challenges and flashbacks
There are 5 things required for exploring
Pathfinding, Weather, Camping, Environment, Zoology
Each player chooses one and does some check or RP or action to say how they prepared for it? Or Choose a action and describe how they use it to overcome that aspect of the exploration, there success or failure then effects how the exploration went. Did they stumble across a beast or did layout traps.

Random events based of results






Catabolic/ anabolic Points
Name for exhaustion, spend on certain high power actions. Or for exploring?
Ideas
Body parts should be based on existing animals, rather than just whatever.

ALignments: predator vs Prey or Carnivore/OmniVOre/Herbivore

Prey may be more focused on defence whereas predator gets more attack focussed

Interesting setup of a character that attacks by being attacked, poison skin.

Use fossils as well, old limbs form dinosaurs pretty cool.

Phoenix wings or dragon wings -> could be enabled through tattoos? Or explained with high level mutations


Overloading: putting too many body parts, could switch between senses by covering them up with devbuff? But all connected all the time. -> sensory and organ slots are soft limits, but could be overloaded.

Each body part is categorised by an animal kingdom, and gets a set bonus. -> Might discourage mutation, mabey drugs get locked off, like there is a disadvantage as well as an advantage to getting a set bonus.

ANimal Kingdom sets get different bonuses.

Body parts can have reaction or instinctual moves, that get triggered when something goes wrong.

Vultures, scavenger animals are better and collecitngl imbs without damage.
Svanvenging animals parts allow you to not oblitereated.
Could repair parts.

Pack parts. Parts that work =well together between party members. Or if they are matching they get a bonus

Hares, cows herds
Hares pund feet on the ground and others can sense it. COmmunicate through pounding.
GOOD FOR NATURALLY WEAKER ANIMALS -> HERDING

Think about supporting moves.

Animals that make stuff - milk form cows, bees make honey.

Combat needs to be rethought for head and Torso

Require Starting Organs
Po pA PIll
Require: Stomach
This is the action for taking drugs



Creating a Character
Build a Body.
Select 1 Torso, 1 Head, 4 Limbs, 4 Phalanges.
Everybody has a base 10 movement Speed.

Torso
Select Size: Tiny, Small or Medium
Select Plating: None, Fured, Tough Skin
Organ Spaces: 3
Head
Sense Spaces: 3
Limbs
Choose 4 Limbs: Each either +1 FLX or +1 BRT
Phalange
Choose 4 phalanges Out of the following
Simple Feet
Simple Hand
Claw Nail
Simple Wing
Simple Fin
Spike Nail
Bone Maul
Nail Shield

Some Senses require a particular brain.
Eyes (Blind, Proper Sight, Keen Sight, Dark Sight, True Sight) 
Ears (Deaf, Proper Hearing, EchoLocation, EavesHearing)
Nose (Anosmia, Proper Smell, Full Smell, Precise Smell)
Magnetic Sense
Vibration Sense
Mood/Empath Sense
organs
Stomach (Poor, Regular, Good, Efficient) -> drugs
Brain (Instinctual, Functioning, Advanced, Complex)
Heart (Weak, Consistent, Strong, Powerful)
Lungs?
Fat?
Liver? -> positions, immunities, alcoholism, blood thingoes?


Plating
None +1 FLX
Fured +1 BRT
Tough Skin -1 ATK 
Shelled -2 ATK
Plated -2 ATK +1 FLX
DRUG IDEA
A drug that erupts all the cells into a tumour monster, new stats and attacks, lasts for a fight. Abomination. RIsk you lose limbs when you revert back or it stays cancerous.


Parasites
Something bad something good when you
LORE IDEAS




Factions from a war in the precious world
WOrld is constantly in turmoil and chaotic.

There are some neutral zones

Factions
War people.
Purists (Anti Mutants)
Reconstructionists that are just wrong -> bunny with kanga legs
Precursor Race (Humans) Worshippers as gods
The evolutionists -> reach peak through mutation.
Cyber people
Humans underground -> make robot animals to heal the earth (unaware of what's actually going on) This never occurred drug was successful so experiment never eventuated, but somewhere robots are stored underground. - possibly the human worshippers release in the wild. Or they are still underground.

Domains
THe Surface world with mutant animals
THe caves and underground -> prehistoric parts
The faciliiteis of the last humans -> Robot parts.


The thing that caused change
Most people mutated
SOme can swap put limbs
And some are highly mutable.


IDeas for what caused the change
Nuclear winter (This is boring and sucks)
Sun expansion or intensity or Ozone deprecation resulted in more UV light changing DNA. (Environment might be fucked) -> ecosystem mutates to survive.
A biological weapon (MIght also be boring)
Scientists experimenting with dna
Old Rules
Most rolls in Chimaera Syndrome are Challenges. When asked to challenge, both the character doing the action and the character who is the target of the action are required to roll.
Note the Table below to find the outcomes.
Challenger: The one that initiated the contention
Challenged: The one that is the target of the contention.
Difference Between The Rolls 
Outcome (greater detail specified in actions.)
11 or Greater (In favour of the Challenger)
Critical Success  45/400 11%
0-10 (In Favour of the Challenger)
Success 165/400 41%
1-10 (In Favour of the Challenged)
Partial Fail 85/400 37%
11 or Greater (In favour of the Challenged)
Critical Failure 45/400 11%


Drugs are Dangerous and Powerful: In the world of Chimaera Syndrome the research into a medication to save life resulted in the development of multitudes of enhancers, psychedelics and depressants. Drugs in Chimaera are the magic in other settings. They allow for you to get temporary boosts or exert some wacky power, however beware, because they are extremely tumultuous and could result in temporary, permanent or fatal reactions.
